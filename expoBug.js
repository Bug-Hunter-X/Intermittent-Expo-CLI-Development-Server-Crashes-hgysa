While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error messages in the console. This would occur intermittently, making development unpredictable.  The project was relatively simple, and I couldn't identify any obvious code issues that would cause such crashes. I've tried restarting the server, clearing the cache, and reinstalling Expo CLI, but the problem persisted.
