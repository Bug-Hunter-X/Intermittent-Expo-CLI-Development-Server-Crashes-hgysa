After extensive debugging and testing, the solution remains elusive. While the initial problem could potentially be a result of memory leaks, operating system conflicts or even Expo CLI bugs, a reliable workaround or fix for this particular problem has not been found at this time. The investigation will continue.  As a temporary workaround, frequent saving and restarting of the Expo CLI development server might lessen the disruption caused by random crashes.  If more specific details can be provided, such as the Expo SDK version, the Node.js version, the operating system, and the contents of the project, this will help in the investigation.
