# Expo CLI Development Server Random Crashes

This repository demonstrates a problem where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing any helpful error messages in the console. The issue is intermittent and makes development difficult.  Solutions attempted (without success) include restarting the server, clearing the cache, and reinstalling the Expo CLI.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the development server for unexpected crashes.

## Potential Causes and Solutions (Under Investigation)

The root cause is currently unknown.  Possible avenues to explore include:

* **Memory leaks:**  The application may have memory leaks causing the server to crash.
* **Expo CLI bugs:** There might be an underlying bug in the Expo CLI itself.
* **Third-party library conflicts:**  Conflicts with dependencies could lead to instability.
* **Operating system issues:**  Underlying issues with the developer's operating system could be at fault.
